  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>These are some projects that I have either done by myself for no other
     reason than for the pleasure of doing something or because it was a
     university project. They are all on my <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918">GitHub</a>,
     so you can check them out there.</p>

   <div class="project">
     <h2 class="date">Revolut Budgetting App</h2>
     <p class="date">AUG 2022</p>
     <div class="inline">
     <img src="Images/DALL·E 2022-08-09 10.35.34 - Capital letter R in neon style with diagrams surrounding it, digital art.png"
     alt="DALL·E2 Logo" class="styled" width="30%">
     <p>App logo created using DALL·E 2</p>
     </div>
     <p>Coded a MATLAB app that lets you see statistics of your Revolut statement (downloaded
       from their website as a .csv file). The app lets you filter the data and also create text
       to input in <a href="https://sankeymatic.com/build/">https://sankeymatic.com/build/</a> to get
       a Sankey diagram of your statement.</p>
       <p>The data can be grouped so that the Sankey diagrams are not so filled with nodes that area
       impossible to read.</p>
       <div class="inline">
         <img src="Images/RevBudg.png" alt="Revolut Budgetting" width="60%" class="styled"/>
       </div>
       <p>You can find the app <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918/RevolutBudgeting">here</a>.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="project">
     <h2 class="date">Arizona Eye Model</h2>
     <p class="date">JUL 2022</p>
     <p>Put together a quick MATLAB file that shows the Arizona Eye Model
     and you can cast rays from the front of the eye to see where they strike
     the retina.</p>
     <p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918/EyeModel">here</a>.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="project">
     <h2 class="date">House Style</h2>
     <p class="date">APR 2022</p>
     <p>I created a LaTeX class for the House Style of the department of
       material sciences & engineering in The University of Sheffield. The House
       Style class is built on top of the common LaTeX article class.
     </p>
     <p>Here is a picture of the instructions document that I wrote for the class,
        done using the class MSEHouseStyle:</p>
     <div class="inline">
       <img src="Images/HouseStyle.png" alt="House Style image" width="60%" class="styled"/>
     </div>
     <p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918/MSEHouseStyle">this</a> GitHub repo
        to download the class to use in your LaTeX documents.</p>
   </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h2 class="date">Voronoi Tessellation</h2>
    <p class="date">MAR 2022</p>
    <p>I developed a code in MATLAB that creates Voronoi Tessellations in 2D and 3D.
       The 2D ones can be easily visualised in MATLAB plots but the 3D ones are difficult,
       so I used ParaView to visualise them.
    </p>
    <div class="inline">
      <img src="Images/Voronoi1.png" alt="2D Voronoi Tessellation" width="40%" class="styled"/>
      <img src="Images/Voronoi2.png" alt="3D Voronoi Tessellation" width="40%" class="styled"/>
    </div>
    <p>The code just creates random centres inside the grid (the red dots in the
       2D Voronoi Tesellation) and iteratively goes pixel by pixel and finds the
       centre that is the closest and paints it the same color.</p>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918/VoronoiTessellation">this</a> GitHub repo
       to download the code.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h2 class="date">CV in Unity</h2>
    <p class="date">AUG 2021</p>
    <p>Coded a program in Unity Game Engine that has my CV. The style of the program
    mimics (tries to at least) the appearance of old TVs. By now the CV over
    there is outdated but it is cool to play with.</p>
    <div class="inline">
      <img src="Images/CVGame.png" alt="Unity CV program" width="80%" style="styled"/>
    </div>
    <p>The application can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918/CurriculumVitae/releases/tag/v1.0">here</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h2 class="date">Crystal Viewer</h2>
    <p class="date">JUN 2021</p>
    <p>Did a MATLAB app that can be used to visualise and create unit cells from
       crystals. The UI is very bare-bones and there are not that many functionalities
       except viewing miller directions and planes.
    </p>
    <p>The code is supposed to work with all crystal systems, but the only ones I
        am sure it works with is cubic, tetragonal and orthorombic systems.</p>
    <div class="inline">
      <img src="Images/CrystalViewer.png" alt="CrystalViewer UI" width="80%" class="styled"/>
    </div>
    <p>It is difficult to understand anything when there are a lot of atoms, and I
       did not add the capability to change the size of the atomic species which
       would greatly improve visibility in some cases.</p>
    <p>The program can be installed from <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918/CrystalViewer/releases/tag/v1.0">here</a>
       (only available for Windows, unless you have MATLAB then you can download the
       source code from the <a href="https://github.com/Parzival1918/CrystalViewer">repository</a> and run it anywhere).</p>
